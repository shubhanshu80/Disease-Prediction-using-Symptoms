# **Overview**

This project is a machine learning-based application designed to predict diseases based on a user's selected symptoms. The prediction is made using four different algorithms: **Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour, and Naive Bayes**. The user interacts with the application through a simple Tkinter GUI, and the prediction results are stored in an **SQLite database**.

## **Features**

**Multiple ML algorithms:** Uses Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour, and Naive Bayes to provide diverse predictions.<br>
**User-friendly GUI:** Built with Tkinter, the interface allows users to select symptoms and view predictions easily.<br>
**Final prediction:** After viewing results from all algorithms, users can click the "Final Prediction" button to get a consolidated prediction.<br>
**Database storage:** All user data, including patient names and symptoms, is stored in an SQLite database.<br>

## **Tech Stack**

**Programming Language:** Python<br>
**GUI:** Tkinter<br>
**Machine Learning Algorithms:**<br>
<ul>
  <li>Decision Tree</li>
  <li>Random Forest</li>
  <li>K-Nearest Neighbour</li>
  <li>Naive Bayes</li>
</ul>

**Database:** SQLite<br>
**Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook<br>

## **How It Works**

**Input:** The user provides their name and selects five symptoms from a predefined list.<br>
**Prediction:** Upon clicking the "Predict All" button, the application uses four machine learning models to predict potential diseases based on the symptoms.<br>
**Final Outcome:** The user can then click the "Final Prediction" button to see a consolidated prediction based on the results of the four algorithms.<br>
**Database Storage:** The patient's details and predictions are saved in an SQLite database, which can be accessed through the SQLite browser for further analysis.<br>


| Algorithm            | Accuracy |
|----------------------|----------|
| Decision Tree        | 93%      |
| Random Forest        | 95%      |
| K-Nearest Neighbour  | 92%      |
| Naive Bayes          | 93%      |


## **Setup Instructions**

Ensure you have one of the **Jupyter Notebook or VS Code**.

Download the code file, testing and training dataset.

Upload them on any development environment and run it.

## **Future Improvements**

1. Adding more symptoms and diseases to enhance the prediction model.
2. Incorporating more sophisticated ML models like SVM or Neural Networks for better accuracy.
3. Implementing a web-based interface using Django/Flask for broader accessibility.

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning with a user-friendly interface for disease prediction. The use of multiple algorithms offers varied insights, making the final outcome more reliable.
