The "Disease Prediction using Machine Learning" project aims to assist in the early diagnosis of diseases based on a set of symptoms provided by the user. 
The project utilizes machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes to predict the disease based on the input symptoms. 
The system is designed to provide quick and accurate predictions, enabling prompt medical intervention and treatment. 
The project utilizes a dataset containing a list of symptoms and corresponding diseases, which is used to train the machine learning models. 
The trained models are then used to predict the disease based on the symptoms provided by the user. 
The system also calculates the accuracy of the predictions, providing insights into the reliability of the predictions. 
The user interface of the system is implemented using the Tkinter library in Python, providing a simple and intuitive way for users to input their symptoms and receive the predicted disease. 
The system containing information about the symptoms, predicted disease, and the accuracy of the prediction. 
Overall, the "Disease Prediction using Machine Learning" project serves as a valuable tool for early disease detection and can potentially improve healthcare outcomes by enabling timely intervention and treatment.
